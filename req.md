Act as an expert Frontend Web Developer. Your task is to generate the complete code for a modern, responsive, and professional personal portfolio single-page application (SPA). 



Please use React.js and Tailwind CSS for the styling. The design should feature a sleek "Dark Mode" aesthetic (inspired by modern developer tools) with a clean UI, smooth scrolling, and interactive hover states.
